# AutoCompleteMe Program:	

	Program in JAVA which implements the autocomplete function as follows:
	
	1. Reads words from files given to you by creating a database of suggested words
	2. Inserts each word read in a dictionary structure which forms the basis for proposing words from the program.
	3. After completing the reading process the program is able to propose to the user words 
		based on the word prefix (string) he introduces a time.
	4. Storage and retrieval of the dictionary in binary format.
	
# What is an AutoCompleteMe system?
	In case you don't have a picture of it yet, you use it in your everyday life:

Our AutoCompleteMe system works on .txt files you give and builds a dictionary-tree structure.

It could be modified to get content from the web or have a GUI for the suggestions it makes for you.
